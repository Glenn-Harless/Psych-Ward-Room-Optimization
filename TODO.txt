It would be nice to show every configuratin and how that compares with each other.


Currently 2024/08/30 we only calculate efficiency/wasted beds in the following concept:

- Single room patient ends in a double bed room, that new bed is wasted


By this standard then, the most efficient configuration would be 26 single beds because then a bed would
NEVER go wasted.

We need to add some new weighting/concepts:
-  whenever a double room patient has to go in a single room

so that we can show that 26 single rooms isnt optimal and is a waste of space and costs more $$$
