# Phase 2 Completion Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Extracted and Refactored Core Optimization Logic ✓

#### **src/core/optimizer.py**
- Refactored `WardOptimizer` class with configuration-based approach
- Integrated with new logging and file handling utilities
- Added comprehensive result extraction and saving capabilities
- Improved error handling and validation
- Added execution time tracking decorator

#### **src/core/constraints.py**
- Created `ConstraintBuilder` class for modular constraint construction
- Separated bed capacity, daily allocation, and accumulation constraints
- Added support for custom constraints and minimum room requirements
- Improved constraint naming and tracking

#### **src/core/objective.py**
- Created `ObjectiveBuilder` class for flexible objective functions
- Supports multiple objective types:
  - Minimize total waste (default)
  - Minimize wasted beds only
  - Minimize wasted potential only
  - Custom weighted objectives
  - Multi-period objectives
- Configurable weights for different waste components

### 2. Refactored Model Evaluators ✓

#### **src/models/base_model.py**
- Created abstract `BaseModel` class defining common interface
- Implemented shared functionality:
  - Data loading and filtering
  - Daily evaluation framework
  - Metrics calculation
  - Results saving
  - Model comparison
- Enforces consistent behavior across all models

#### **src/models/current_model.py**
- Refactored `CurrentModel` inheriting from `BaseModel`
- Simplified to focus only on model-specific logic
- Clear documentation of current configuration behavior

#### **src/models/optimized_model.py**
- Refactored `OptimizedModel` with configurable room counts
- Added `CustomModel` for testing arbitrary configurations
- Uses configuration defaults from YAML files
- Improved waste calculation logic

### 3. Created Comprehensive Analysis Modules ✓

#### **src/analysis/capacity_analyzer.py**
- `CapacityAnalyzer` class for detailed capacity utilization analysis
- Features:
  - Maximum capacity detection
  - Turn-away event tracking
  - Utilization rate calculations
  - Room usage details
  - Capacity event logging
  - Model comparison capabilities

#### **src/analysis/efficiency_calculator.py**
- `EfficiencyCalculator` static class for efficiency metrics
- Calculations include:
  - Daily and cumulative efficiency
  - Weighted efficiency with configurable weights
  - Rolling average efficiency
  - Efficiency trends by period
  - Comprehensive metrics (percentiles, variance, etc.)
  - Model efficiency comparison

#### **src/analysis/waste_analyzer.py**
- `WasteAnalyzer` static class for waste pattern analysis
- Features:
  - Detailed waste statistics
  - Consecutive waste day tracking
  - Peak waste identification
  - Waste triggers analysis
  - Financial impact calculation
  - Period-wise waste analysis
  - Model waste comparison

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
- Clear separation between optimization engine, models, and analysis
- Each module has single, well-defined responsibility
- Easy to extend with new models or analysis types

### 2. **Configuration-Based Design**
- All hardcoded values moved to configuration files
- Easy to test different ward configurations
- Supports multiple deployment scenarios

### 3. **Comprehensive Analysis Suite**
- Three specialized analyzers for different aspects
- Rich metrics and comparison capabilities
- Financial impact assessment

### 4. **Improved Code Quality**
- Consistent use of type hints
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Better error handling
- Logging throughout

### 5. **Extensibility**
- Abstract base class makes adding new models trivial
- Modular constraints and objectives
- Pluggable analysis components

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Clear module boundaries and responsibilities
2. **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Components can be mixed and matched
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without touching existing code
5. **Documentation**: Self-documenting code with clear interfaces

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. Organize data pipeline with modular preprocessing
2. Refactor visualization system into focused modules
3. Create command-line scripts for different workflows
4. Move documentation to dedicated folder

The core refactoring is complete, providing a solid foundation for the remaining phases.
