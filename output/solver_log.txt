Problem MODEL has 2839 rows, 950 columns and 227988 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 74 - 0.02 seconds
Cgl0003I 0 fixed, 2 tightened bounds, 9 strengthened rows, 0 substitutions
Cgl0004I processed model has 1872 rows, 940 columns (940 integer (9 of which binary)) and 222795 elements
