Held beds are isolated single rooms


As it is right now, if a patient (under this new model) would be placed in a single room

How it works right now:
- all rooms are double rooms (2 beds)
- since they need their own room, that extra bed is wasted
- that extra bed = held beds

Output goal we are looking for:
- available beds for the last year

Under new system:
- its possible we wouldnt be accept all patients

Available beds under old set up compared to available beds on new set up

- goal is to maximize occupancy
- minimize wasted beds


Old metric (all double rooms):
    - wasted beds = total held beds

How does a room become wasted under new model (combination of single rooms + double rooms)
- if single rooms fill up, can they go into open double rooms?
    - that would be a wasted bed
- Sent away patients?


I think the goal is to minimize wasted beds, so single room patients CAN go into double rooms


Old Model:
- Wasted Beds = "Held Beds":
    Held bed is when a psychotic patient has to be in a single room, old model has all double rooms so second bed is wasted

New Models:
- Wasted Beds:
    - Will only be wasted once all single rooms are filled up
    - any new psychotic patients will have to go in a double room
    - if a double room is filled up with a psychotic patient , then the second bed is wasted


# TODO: Train on a year of data
- if "double room patients" is "-" then it is 0
but the total availale beds becomes 26 - (that difference)
 - omit it for now for simplicity then we can come revisit

 - If census is 12, held beds is 14 then single room patients = 12, double room patients = 0

 
 Output goals:
 - Graphs:
    Show wasted beds under old model compared with wasted beds under new model
        Cumulative
        Daily

    Have a spreadsheet to go along with that
